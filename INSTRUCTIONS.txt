Pole Placement Controller

To synthesize a pole placement controller, use the MATLAB script pole_placement.m located in the Others directory. This script calls the auxiliary function bezoutd_AB.m to perform the pole placement control design.



H-Infinity Controller

For H-Infinity controller synthesis, utilize the MATLAB script hinf_design.m located in the Others directory. This script is designed to handle H-Infinity control design.



Genetic Algorithm Controller

To synthesize a controller using the Genetic Algorithm, please refer to the INSTRUCTIONS.txt file inside the GA directory. It contains detailed instructions on how to run the genetic algorithm for controller design.
