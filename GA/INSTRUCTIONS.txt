Genetic Algorithm Controller

This folder contains files intended to synthesize a controller using a genetic algorithm. The main file, ga_controller.m, should be executed with the necessary modifications. The file controller_test.m contains the cost function for the genetic algorithm, and it should be modified to adjust the cost function's parameters. The .mat files contain the coefficients R and S of different controllers synthesized by the genetic algorithm. You can visualize the cost function parameters of each controller by comparing their names with the names of the controller_test_??? functions.

The final controller files synthesized in Rafael Correa's work are the following:
ga_controller.m
controller_test_ok_10.m
ga_ok_10.mat


File Descriptions:

ga_controller.m: The main file responsible for executing the genetic algorithm for controller synthesis. Make sure to modify it according to your specific requirements.

controller_test.m: Contains the cost function used in the genetic algorithm. Modify this file to adjust the parameters of the cost function as needed.

.mat files: These files store the coefficients R and S of controllers obtained through the genetic algorithm.

GA_test.slx: This simulation file is executed at each iteration of the genetic algorithm.

systems_parameters.mat: Contains the parameters of the system plant.




Getting Started
To use the genetic algorithm controller synthesis, follow these steps:

Open ga_controller.m and make any necessary changes.

Modify controller_test.m to design and implement your specific cost function based on the problem requirements.

Run ga_controller.m after setting up the necessary configurations.

The genetic algorithm will evolve the controllers, and the resulting coefficients R and S must be saved in the corresponding .mat files.

Use the obtained controllers for your specific system by loading the appropriate .mat file and applying it to your control loop.
